experimenting with geofencing for apple airtags.
My father in law has dementia and is prone to wandering off.

## TODO
- [ ] find a way for service accounts or other ways to remain logged into apple
      so that a github actions can continually scrape the location of an airtag.
      https://github.com/malmeloo/FindMy.py/issues/48
- [ ] Detect when a geofence is crossed.
- [ ] Set up a zapier or something to schedule a google calendar event with an
      immediate alarm when the airtage leaves a geofence. Or some other way of
      alerting us.
